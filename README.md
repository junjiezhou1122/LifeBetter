# LifeBetter Meta-Learning System

## Overview
LifeBetter is a meta-learning system designed to improve various aspects of life through adaptive learning algorithms and intelligent systems. This project focuses on developing a system that can learn how to learn better over time, adapting to individual needs and circumstances.

## Goals
- Develop a flexible meta-learning framework
- Create adaptive systems for personal improvement
- Build tools for continuous learning and optimization
- Implement feedback mechanisms for iterative improvement

## Structure
- `docs/` - Documentation and specifications
- `src/` - Source code for the meta-learning system
- `tests/` - Unit tests and integration tests
- `config/` - Configuration files
- `scripts/` - Utility scripts
- `memory/` - Memory and learning records
