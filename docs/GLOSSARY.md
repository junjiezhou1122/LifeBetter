# LifeBetter Glossary

## A

### Adaptation
The process by which the meta-learning system modifies its learning strategies based on past experiences and current task requirements.

### API (Application Programming Interface)
The set of functions and protocols that allow interaction with the LifeBetter system.

## B

### Black-box Testing
A testing method that examines the functionality of the system without peering into its internal structures or workings.

## C

### Component
A modular, deployable, replaceable part of a system that encapsulates implementation and exposes a set of interfaces.

### Configuration
The arrangement of settings that determine how the LifeBetter system operates, including parameters like memory size and learning rate.

## D

### Data Model
An abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.

### Debugging
The process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in software code.

### Dependency Injection
A technique where one object supplies the dependencies of another object, promoting loose coupling.

## E

### Experience
A record of a learning task including input, output, outcome, and metadata that contributes to the meta-learning process.

### Experience Memory
The storage system that retains learning experiences for future reference and pattern recognition.

### Exploratory Testing
Testing without detailed planning and documentation, focusing on discovering unexpected behaviors.

## F

### Factory Pattern
A creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### Feature Branch
A version control branch used to develop new features isolated from other development work.

## G

### Git
A distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.

## H

### Heuristic
A problem-solving approach that uses practical methods or shortcuts to produce solutions that may not be optimal but are sufficient for a given set of goals.

## I

### Integration Testing
Testing conducted to evaluate the compliance of a system or component with specified functional requirements when integrated with other components.

### Interface
A shared boundary across which two separate components exchange information.

### Iteration
A single execution of a set of instructions or code in a loop or repetitive process.

## J

### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
A lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.

## K

### Knowledge Base
A centralized repository of information that represents facts, rules, and relationships used by the meta-learning system.

## L

### Learning Rate
A hyperparameter that controls how much to change the model in response to the estimated error each time the model weights are updated.

### Learning Strategy
A systematic approach to acquiring knowledge or skills, including methods, techniques, and parameters for the learning process.

### Library
A collection of precompiled routines that a program can use to perform common tasks.

## M

### Meta-Knowledge
Knowledge about knowledge; information about learning processes, patterns, and strategies accumulated through experience.

### Meta-Learning
A subfield of machine learning focused on designing models that can adapt to new tasks quickly with minimal training data; "learning to learn."

### Module
A file containing Python definitions and statements that can be imported and used in other Python programs.

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
A version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future product development.

## N

### Namespace
A container that holds a set of identifiers (names) and ensures that all the identifiers in it are unique and can be used without conflict.

## O

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
A programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code that manipulates that data.

### Overfitting
When a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance on new data.

## P

### Parameter
A special kind of variable used in a subroutine to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the subroutine.

### Performance Metrics
Quantitative measures used to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the meta-learning system.

### Pipeline
A series of processing elements connected by communication channels, where the output of each element is the input of the next.

### Protocol
A set of rules that define how data is exchanged between different systems.

## Q

### Query
A request for data or information from a database table or combination of tables.

## R

### Refactoring
The process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior to improve non-functional attributes.

### Repository
A central location in which data is stored and managed, typically used in version control systems.

### Return Type
The type of value that a function returns when it finishes executing.

## S

### Serialization
The process of converting an object or data structure from its in-memory representation to a format suitable for storage or transmission.

### Software Architecture
The fundamental structures of a software system and the discipline of creating such structures.

### Strategy Pattern
A behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime, allowing clients to interact with different algorithms through a uniform interface.

### System Integration
The process of bringing together the component parts of a system for the purpose of testing.

## T

### Test Case
A set of conditions or variables under which a tester will determine whether an application or software system is working correctly.

### Test Coverage
A measurement of how many lines of code are executed when tests are run.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
A software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests.

### Tuple
An immutable sequence of Python objects, similar to a list but cannot be changed once created.

## U

### Unit Test
A type of software testing that verifies the smallest testable parts of an application, typically individual functions or methods.

### User Story
A description consisting of one or more sentences in the everyday or business language of the end user that captures what a user does or needs to do as part of his or her job function.

## V

### Variable
A symbolic name associated with a value and whose associated value may be changed.

### Version Control
A system that records changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

## W

### White-box Testing
Testing methodology where the internal structure or working of the application is known and tested.

### Workflow
The sequence of industrial, administrative, or other processes through which a piece of work passes from initiation to completion.

## X

### XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
A markup language that defines rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.

## Y

### YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)
A human-readable data serialization standard that can be used in conjunction with all programming languages and is often used for configuration files.

## Z

### Zen of Python
A collection of 19 "guiding principles" for writing computer programs that influence the design of the Python programming language.
