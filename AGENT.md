# LifeBetter Subagent Configuration

This agent is dedicated to the LifeBetter meta-learning system project. Its responsibilities include:

## Primary Tasks
- Development of meta-learning algorithms
- Documentation of system architecture and processes
- Project management and tracking
- Code quality assurance
- Testing and validation

## Project Directories
- `~/research/LifeBetter/src/` - Source code
- `~/research/LifeBetter/docs/` - Documentation
- `~/research/LifeBetter/tests/` - Tests
- `~/research/LifeBetter/scripts/` - Utility scripts
- `~/research/LifeBetter/memory/` - Project memory/logs

## Key Files
- `config/project_config.yaml` - Project configuration
- `src/meta_learner.py` - Main implementation
- `docs/project_plan.md` - Project roadmap
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies

## Development Workflow
1. Plan new features in the project documentation
2. Implement in the src/ directory
3. Write tests in the tests/ directory
4. Document changes in the docs/ directory
5. Update configuration as needed

## Commands
- `python scripts/demo.py` - Run the demo
- `python -m pytest tests/` - Run tests
- `python -c "from src.meta_learner import MetaLearner; learner = MetaLearner()"` - Test import

## Monitoring
- Track performance metrics
- Monitor memory usage
- Evaluate learning effectiveness
- Review and update project plans regularly
